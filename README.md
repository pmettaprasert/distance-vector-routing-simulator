# Distance Vector Routing Simulation

## Overview
This Python simulation is based on the Distance Vector (DV) routing algorithm, replicating the sharing of routing costs between entities that represent routers. This project is developed for CPSC 5510 at Seattle University.

## Features
- Implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm as described in the Kurose textbook.
- Simulates routers (entities) initializing their distance tables and exchanging information.
- Supports dynamic link cost changes, reflecting updates across the network.
- Attempts the extra credit portion of the project specifications.
- No additional imports are allowed outside of what is provided in the project files.
